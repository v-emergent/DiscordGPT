Introduction to Emergent
Emergent is an end-to-end agentic platform designed to help developers and builders go from an idea to a fully deployable product within a single, integrated environment. It eliminates the need for using multiple fragmented tools and services, making development easier, faster, and more efficient. With Emergent, you can automate your project generation, manage your backend and frontend, integrate APIs, and deploy your product with ease, all while keeping your app scalable and secure.

Key Features of Emergent
1. Smart Planning with Neo
Emergent begins with Neo, a smart planning agent that guides you through the initial stages of project development. You provide your project idea, and Neo:
Translates the idea into a scalable system architecture.


Recommends the best technology stack (e.g., FastAPI, React, MongoDB).


Designs a customized development roadmap to help you meet your project’s requirements.


2. Automated Project Scaffolding
Once Neo has created your project plan, Emergent automatically generates the entire project structure, including the backend, frontend, and database integration:
Backend: Emergent uses FastAPI to create a secure, high-performance backend.


Frontend: It generates a React-based frontend that is both responsive and modern.


Database: MongoDB integration is set up for your app to store and manage data efficiently.


3. Sub-Agent System
Emergent features a sub-agent system that automates task distribution across specialized agents:
Backend Sub-Agent: Handles API generation, server-side logic, and database setup.


Frontend Sub-Agent: Takes care of UI generation and ensures accessibility and responsiveness.


API Integration Sub-Agent: Automatically connects external APIs and manages data flow.


These agents work together to deliver a fully functional product.
4. ECU (Emergent Compute Units) System
ECUs are the fuel that powers all tasks in Emergent:
You get 50 free ECUs on sign-up.


You can purchase 200 ECUs for $20 after you run out of the free allocation.


Tasks like code generation, deployment, and bug fixing consume ECUs, with larger tasks consuming more resources.


Managing ECUs efficiently is key:
Use rollback to clear unnecessary chat history while keeping your code intact. This helps save ECUs.


5. Rollback and Context Management
The rollback feature is essential for saving ECUs:
Clear Context: After completing each task, clear the chat history using rollback. This ensures that ECU consumption stays low because it reduces the amount of history the system needs to process.


Keep Code Intact: You can choose to delete the history while keeping the code, which helps you proceed with future tasks without losing progress.


Best Practice:
Use rollback after each major task to reset the environment and save ECUs.


After each rollback, ask Emergent to summarize what has been completed and what is still pending.


6. GitHub Integration
Emergent’s GitHub integration allows users to easily manage their code and track progress:
Push Code to GitHub: After completing a feature or task, you can push the code to GitHub to save it as a checkpoint.


Pull Code from GitHub: If you need to continue a task after a rollback, simply pull the code from GitHub to resume your work.


This integration ensures that your code is backed up, versioned, and accessible for collaboration.
7. VS Code Integration
Emergent integrates seamlessly with VS Code, allowing you to:
Edit the code generated by Emergent directly within VS Code.


Sync changes made in VS Code with the generated code and continue development.


How to Use VS Code Integration:
Open VS Code and connect it to your Emergent project.


Use VS Code’s features (syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, etc.) to modify the generated code.


Push your changes back to GitHub once you’re done editing in VS Code.


8. Continuous Testing and QA Automation
Emergent includes built-in testing to ensure that your application is robust:
API Testing: Specialized agents automatically perform API testing to ensure that all endpoints are working correctly.


End-to-End Testing: Agents test the flow of your application to make sure everything works as expected.


Playwright Coverage: Automatic Playwright coverage ensures that the UI is functioning properly across different browsers.


9. One-Click Deployment with Built-In Flexibility
Once your product is ready, deploying is as easy as clicking a button:
Deploy to the cloud with one-click.


Custom domains and production-grade infrastructure are available out-of-the-box.


Future Update:
One-click deployment will include custom domain integration, making it even easier to deploy your app without worrying about DevOps configurations.


10. Security and Scalability by Default
Emergent’s infrastructure is designed with enterprise-grade security and scalability:
No need to rebuild for scale: Your application is automatically scalable and secure as your user base grows.


Security measures are built-in, ensuring that your application is protected from potential threats.



How to Use Emergent Efficiently
Procedure 1: Develop and Push to GitHub, Then Rollback
Start by providing a clear prompt for the first feature.


Push the code to GitHub after completing the feature.


Use rollback to delete unnecessary messages and save ECUs while keeping your code.


Ask Emergent to summarize the task — this ensures that only the incomplete tasks are worked on next.


Proceed with Feature 2 following the same process.


Procedure 2: Pushing to GitHub, Opening a New Chat, and Task Focus
Start by providing a clear prompt for the feature you want to build.


After the feature is developed, push the code to GitHub to save your work.


Open a new chat and upload the previous code.


Summarize:


Clearly state what has been done up to that point.


List what needs to be done next.


Ask Emergent to focus on one task and complete it (instead of handling multiple tasks).


Repeat the process:


After completing the task, push to GitHub again, and open a new chat for the next task.


Continue this cycle until the project is complete.
